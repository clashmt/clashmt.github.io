 abstract = {Adherence to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) among young sexual and gender minority men who have sex with men (YSGMMSM) has been suboptimal for reducing HIV incidence in the United States. Using the syndemic framework, the present study characterized how neighborhood disadvantage and clustering of two or more syndemic conditions (depression, anxiety, polysubstance use, history of arrest, BIPOC racial identity, unemployment) was related to PrEP non-adherence among 212 YSGMMSM aged 16–24. This study is a secondary analysis of an efficacy trial testing a PrEP adherence digital intervention for YSGMMSM combining participant survey and biological PrEP adherence data with measures of neighborhood disadvantage. Using multilevel models, we found that YSGMMSM residing in high-disadvantage neighborhoods were 2.79 (CI = 1.11, 7.00) times more likely to have a cluster of syndemic conditions compared to those in low-disadvantage neighborhoods. YSGMMSM residing in high-disadvantage neighborhoods were 3.14 (OR = 3.14, CI = 1.17, 8.44) times more likely to be PrEP non-adherent. YSGMMSM with two or more syndemic conditions were 2.64 (CI = 1.01, 6.94) times more likely to be PrEP non-adherent compared to those with 0 or 1 condition. Among participants living in high-disadvantage neighborhoods, 38% had a cluster of a syndemic conditions compared 20% in low-disadvantage neighborhoods. Despite this, neighborhood disadvantage did not significantly moderate the relationship between clustering of syndemic conditions and PrEP non-adherence among YSGMMSM. Further research into multilevel syndemic influences on PrEP adherence is needed to develop strategies for improving HIV vulnerability among YSGMMSM.},
