 abstract = {Cannabis retailer locations used to investigate geographic cannabis access are frequently ascertained from two sources: 1) webservices which provide locations of cannabis retailers (e.g., Yelp) or 2) government-maintained registries. Characterizing the operating status and location information accuracy of cannabis retailer data sources on a state-by-state level can inform research examining the health implications of cannabis legalization policies. This study ascertained cannabis retailer name and location from webservices and government-maintained registries for 26 states and the District of Columbia legalizing cannabis sales in 2019. Validation subsamples were created using state-level sequential sampling. Phone surveys were conducted by trained researchers for webservice samples (n=790, November 2019 – May 2020) and government-maintained registry (n=859, February – June 2020) to ascertain information about operating status and location. Accuracy was calculated as the percent agreement among subsample and phone survey data. For operating status and location, webservice derived data was 78% (614/790) and 79% (484/611) accurate, whereas government-maintained registry derived data was 76% (657/859) and 95% (622/655) accurate, respectively. Fifty-nine percent (15/27) of states and the District of Columbia had over 80% accuracy for operating status and 48% (13/27) states had over 80% accuracy for location information with both data sources. However, government-maintained registry derived information was more accurate in 33% (9/27) states for operating status and 41% (11/27) states for location information. Both data sources had similar operating status accuracy. Research using spatial analysis may prefer government-maintained registry derived data due to high location information accuracy, whereas studies looking at broad trends across states may prefer webservice derived. State level COVID-19 restrictions had minimal impact on ascertainment of cannabis retailer operating status and location information via phone survey derived from webservices and government-maintained registries.},
