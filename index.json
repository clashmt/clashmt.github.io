Research into HIV syndemics has illuminated the importance of social and structural factors for HIV risk, yet the research into HIV syndemics for YSGMSM has been limited to individual level survey measures. This research uses multilevel models to explicitly model neighborhood factors to understand the direct relationship between social and structural neighborhood factors and PrEP adherence. Similarly, immersion in digital spaces (e.g., consumption of social media) can influence HIV risk. Despite interventions for PrEP uptake and adherence being increasingly delivered through digital devices, no studies to date have characterized how digital immersion influences PrEP adherence through a digital PrEP intervention. Finally, it has been shown that joining non-digital support groups can mitigate neighborhood factors in YSGMSM and reduce sexual risk behaviors suggesting that a digital PrEP intervention might have the same capability but with greater reach. This research examines how convergent digital and neighborhood factors impact PrEP adherence in YSGMSM by leveraging iTech’s P3 study, an NICHD-funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) to improve PrEP adherence among YSGMSM. This three arm RCT is designed to assess the effectiveness of P3 and P3+ to improve PrEP adherence among 246 16-24 year-old YSGMSM across nine US study sites. The study collects residential zip code, allowing for examination of neighborhood effects on PrEP adherence. Through mentored training in social and structural neighborhood determinants of PrEP adherence in YSGMSM, multi-level models, mediation analysis, causal inference, and professional development activities, this F31 will achieve the following specific aims: 1) Characterize how neighborhood syndemic risk relates to PrEP adherence in YSGSM, 2) Identify how immersion in digital spaces and communities outside P3’s intervention influence engagement inside P3’s intervention, and subsequent PrEP adherence, 3) Determine how the P3 intervention condition attenuates the relationship between syndemic neighborhood and digital immersion factors’ impact on PrEP adherence. These aims will enrich our understanding of how digital and neighborhood factors impact PrEP adherence, a critical step in precision preventative health against HIV for YSGMSM.\n","date":1658188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658188800,"objectID":"bdfa26a6927262e65ac637c57002a596","permalink":"https://clashmt.github.io/project/f31/","publishdate":"2022-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/f31/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by NICHD, grant #1F31HD108046-01A1","tags":["Digital Interventions","Access"],"title":"Neighborhood and digital immersion effects on PrEP adherence in young sexual and gender minorities who have sex with men","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The crisis of deaths from opioid overdose persists in the United States and Impoverished individuals and those covered by Medicaid are disproportionately affected by the opioid crisis.Despite the availability of efficacious medications for treatment of opioid use disorder, treatment gaps exist.

The validity of these data with respect to retailer existence and location is unclear. This study compares cannabis retailer location information from online listings and government-maintained state registries overall, within states, and by legalization (medical or medical and recreational cannabis use).   Methods: We collected 7,832 cannabis retailer locations from five online listing sources (June 2019) and 7,733 cannabis retailer locations from government registries (May -- October 2019) across 26 states legalizing the sale of cannabis for medical or recreational use. We sequentially sampled 10% of retailers in each state for phone validation (n=826 online listings, conducted November 2019 – May 2020; n=856 government registries, conducted February – June 2020). Proportions of observations validated as operating cannabis retailers at listed locations by source were compared (overall, comparing states with both legalized medical and recreational cannabis use against states with medical only use, and by state) using chi-square tests.   Results: 74% (n=608) and 75% (n=639) of cannabis retailers were operating and located at listed locations for online listings and government-maintained registries, respectively(p=0.626). Across both sources, states with legalized medical and recreational cannabis had higher proportions of validated retailers than states with only legalized medical cannabis (77% and 69% respectively, [ptextless.001]). Data sources are comparable within states except for California, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, and New York which had more validated cannabis retailers when sourced from government registries (p textless.05) and Oklahoma and Oregon which had more validated cannabis retailers from online listings (ptextless.05).   Conclusions: There are state-level differences in the validity of online listings and government-maintained registries of cannabis retailers. Researchers should consider which state location-based research on cannabis retailers is being conducted in to direct choices surrounding data source.","tags":[],"title":"State-level differences in validity of cannabis retailer locations ascertained from online listings and government-maintained state registries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael P.

Such games may suffer from poor retention, potentially due to the constraints that using pre-existing problems place on game design. Previous work has proposed using player rating systems and matchmaking to balance the difficulty of human computation games, and explored the use of rating systems to predict the outcomes of player attempts at levels. However, these predictions were win/loss, which required setting a score threshold to determine if a player won or lost. This may be undesirable in human computation games, where what scores are possible may be unknown. In this work, we examined the use of rating systems for predicting scores, rather than win/loss, of player attempts at levels. We found that, except in cases with a narrow range of scores and little prior information on player performance, Glicko-2 performs favorably to alternative methods.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting Human Computation Game Scores with Player Rating Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anurag Sarkar","Michael Williams","Sebastian Deterding","Seth Cooper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658267175,"objectID":"fc112e26ae0a1763d41780acb1734d5c","permalink":"https://clashmt.github.io/publication/sarkar-engagement-2017/","publishdate":"2022-07-19T21:46:15.032084Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sarkar-engagement-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Human computation games lack established ways of balancing the difficulty of tasks or levels served to players, potentially contributing to their low engagement rates. Traditional player rating systems have been suggested as a potential solution: using them to rate both players and tasks could estimate player skill and task difficulty and fuel player-task matchmaking. However, neither the effect of difficulty balancing on engagement in human computation games nor the use of player rating systems for this purpose has been empirically tested. We therefore examined the engagement effects of using the Glicko-2 player rating system to order tasks in the human computation game Paradox. An online experiment (n=294) found that both matchmaking-based and pure difficulty-based ordering of tasks led to significantly more attempted and completed levels than random ordering. Additionally, both matchmaking and random ordering led to significantly more difficult tasks being completed than pure difficulty-based ordering. We conclude that poor balancing contributes to poor engagement in human computation games, and that player rating system-based difficulty rating may be a viable and efficient way of improving both.","tags":["matchmaking","difficulty balancing","Glicko-2","human computation games","level ordering","player rating systems"],"title":"Engagement Effects of Player Rating System-based Matchmaking for Level Ordering in Human Computation Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Williams","Hassen Gharbi","Aybike Ulusan","Ozlem Ergun","Zhu Xiaofeng","Shiyu Zhang","Casper Harteveld"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658267175,"objectID":"3bb3aba71930e2a54f69b6a03e801474","permalink":"https://clashmt.github.io/publication/williams-toward-2016/","publishdate":"2022-07-19T21:46:15.106694Z","relpermalink":"/publication/williams-toward-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Optimizing operations on critical infrastructure networks is key to reducing the impact of disruptive events.
