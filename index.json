Characterizing the operating status and location information accuracy of cannabis retailer data sources on a state-by-state level can inform research examining the health implications of cannabis legalization policies. This study ascertained cannabis retailer name and location from webservices and government-maintained registries for 26 states and the District of Columbia legalizing cannabis sales in 2019. Validation subsamples were created using state-level sequential sampling. Phone surveys were conducted by trained researchers for webservice samples (n=790, November 2019 – May 2020) and government-maintained registry (n=859, February – June 2020) to ascertain information about operating status and location. Accuracy was calculated as the percent agreement among subsample and phone survey data. For operating status and location, webservice derived data was 78% (614/790) and 79% (484/611) accurate, whereas government-maintained registry derived data was 76% (657/859) and 95% (622/655) accurate, respectively. Fifty-nine percent (15/27) of states and the District of Columbia had over 80% accuracy for operating status and 48% (13/27) states had over 80% accuracy for location information with both data sources. However, government-maintained registry derived information was more accurate in 33% (9/27) states for operating status and 41% (11/27) states for location information. Both data sources had similar operating status accuracy. Research using spatial analysis may prefer government-maintained registry derived data due to high location information accuracy, whereas studies looking at broad trends across states may prefer webservice derived. State level COVID-19 restrictions had minimal impact on ascertainment of cannabis retailer operating status and location information via phone survey derived from webservices and government-maintained registries.","tags":[],"title":"Accuracy Differences in Cannabis Retailer Information Ascertained from Webservices and Government-Maintained State Registries Across US States Legalizing the Sale of Cannabis in 2019","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danielle F.

Women with HIV are an aging population with prevalent cannabis use twice that of national estimates. Because cannabis use may confer both health benefits and risks, it is important to understand cannabis use patterns among women with HIV. This analysis characterized prevalence, frequencies, and modes (smoking, vaping, eating) of cannabis use among 1,246 women with HIV in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study over 18 months (2018–2019). We compared participant characteristics using chi-square tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We illustrated flow between cannabis use frequency categories with a Sankey diagram. Median participant age was 52 years (interquartile range: 46, 58). 65% of participants identified as Black/African American; 50% had annual household incomes textless$12,000. The period prevalence was 27% for any cannabis use and 15% for daily or more use. 50% reported varying use frequencies. Among women using cannabis, 96% reported smoking, 30% consumed edibles, and 18% vaped. Compared with women not using cannabis, greater proportions of women using cannabis reported alcohol (69% vs. 37%, p textless 0.01), cigarette (61% vs. 29%, p textless 0.01) and other drug use (16% vs. 4%, p textless 0.01). Compared to those with no high potency use, a higher proportion of women using high potency products were in a state legalizing cannabis sales. Cannabis use among women with HIV is common and of variable frequency.

Measuring and achieving effective engagement (sufficient to solicit PrEP adherence) in YSGMMSM is challenging. Objective: This study is a secondary analysis of the primary efficacy randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Prepared, Protected, Empowered (P3), a digital PrEP adherence intervention that used causal mediation to quantify whether and to what extent intrapersonal behavioral, mental health, and sociodemographic measures were related to effective engagement for PrEP adherence in YSGMMSM. Methods: In May 2019, 264 YSGMMSM were recruited for the primary RCT via social media, community sites, and clinics from 9 study sites across the United States. For this secondary analysis, 140 participants were eligible (retained at follow-up, received DHI condition in primary RCT, and completed trial data). Participants earned US currency for daily use of P3 and lost US currency for nonuse. Dollars accrued at the 3-month follow-up were used to measure engagement. PrEP nonadherence was defined as blood serum concentrations of tenofovir-diphosphate and emtricitabine-triphosphate that correlated with ≤4 doses weekly at the 3-month follow-up. Logistic regression was used to estimate the total effect of baseline intrapersonal measures on PrEP nonadherence, represented as odds ratios (ORs) with a null value of 1. The total OR for each intrapersonal measure was decomposed into direct and indirect effects. Results: For every US $1 earned above the mean (US $96, SD US $35.1), participants had 2% (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99) lower odds of PrEP nonadherence. Frequently using phone apps to track health information was associated with a 71% (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.06-0.96) lower odds of PrEP nonadherence. This was overwhelmingly a direct effect, not mediated by engagement, with a percentage mediated (PM) of 1%. Non-Hispanic White participants had 83% lower odds of PrEP nonadherence (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.48) and had a direct effect (PM=4%). Participants with depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms had 3.4 (OR 3.42, 95% CI 0.95-12) and 3.5 (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.06-11.55) times higher odds of PrEP nonadherence, respectively. Anxious symptoms largely operated through P3 engagement (PM=51%). Conclusions: P3 engagement (dollars accrued) was strongly related to lower odds of PrEP nonadherence. Intrapersonal measures operating through P3 engagement (indirect effect, eg, anxious symptoms) suggest possible pathways to improve PrEP adherence DHI efficacy in YSGMMSM via effective engagement. Conversely, the direct effects observed in this study may reflect existing structural disparity (eg, race and ethnicity) or behavioral dispositions toward technology (eg, tracking health via phone apps). Evaluating effective engagement in DHIs with causal mediation approaches provides a clarifying and mechanistic view of how DHIs impact health behavior.

Consistent evidence demonstrates that substance use is associated with VAW and that participation in substance use treatment programs is associated with reduction in substance use-related violence. While evidence demonstrates the ability to address VAW through substance use treatment programs, less attention has been paid to geographic access to substance use programs. If these programs are geographically inaccessible, particularly to marginalized populations, many people will not get the help they need. This study seeks to explore the relationship between geographic access to substance use treatment programs on VAW. Using data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 064 study, longitudinal multilevel models were used to assess the relationship between neighborhood-level social determinants, with a specific focus on geographic access to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) certified drug and alcohol treatment programs and VAW. The study included 1910 women, ages 18 to 44, living in select geographic areas with high-ranked prevalence of HIV and poverty. The findings of this study indicate that among women who reside in census tracts with high prevalence rates of HIV: (1) substance use increases VAW; (2) VAW decreases as geographic access to SAMHSA-certified drug and alcohol treatment facilities increases; and (3) when looking at specific types of VAW, emotional and physical abuse decreases as geographic access to substance use treatment increases. Policies and programs to increase access to substance use treatment should be explored and evaluated, and more programs are needed that address the intersectionality of substance use and VAW.","tags":[],"title":"An Exploration of Geographic Access to Substance Use Treatment Programs and Violence Against Women","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael P Williams","Justin Manjourides","Louisa H Smith","Crissi B Rainer","Lisa B Hightow-Weidman","Danielle F Haley"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1719792000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1753226450,"objectID":"3fdded07856b21fff30c733e246b6f81","permalink":"https://clashmt.github.io/publication/michael-p-williams-digital-2024/","publishdate":"2025-07-22T23:20:50.694008Z","relpermalink":"/publication/michael-p-williams-digital-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions (DHIs) for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) in young sexual and gender minority men who have sex with men (YSGMMSM) show promise for reducing HIV burden.

Research into HIV syndemics has illuminated the importance of social and structural factors for HIV risk, yet the research into HIV syndemics for YSGMSM has been limited to individual level survey measures. This research uses multilevel models to explicitly model neighborhood factors to understand the direct relationship between social and structural neighborhood factors and PrEP adherence. Similarly, immersion in digital spaces (e.g., consumption of social media) can influence HIV risk. Despite interventions for PrEP uptake and adherence being increasingly delivered through digital devices, no studies to date have characterized how digital immersion influences PrEP adherence through a digital PrEP intervention. Finally, it has been shown that joining non-digital support groups can mitigate neighborhood factors in YSGMSM and reduce sexual risk behaviors suggesting that a digital PrEP intervention might have the same capability but with greater reach. This research examines how convergent digital and neighborhood factors impact PrEP adherence in YSGMSM by leveraging iTech’s P3 study, an NICHD-funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) to improve PrEP adherence among YSGMSM. This three arm RCT is designed to assess the effectiveness of P3 and P3+ to improve PrEP adherence among 246 16-24 year-old YSGMSM across nine US study sites. The study collects residential zip code, allowing for examination of neighborhood effects on PrEP adherence. Through mentored training in social and structural neighborhood determinants of PrEP adherence in YSGMSM, multi-level models, mediation analysis, causal inference, and professional development activities, this F31 will achieve the following specific aims: 1) Characterize how neighborhood syndemic risk relates to PrEP adherence in YSGSM, 2) Identify how immersion in digital spaces and communities outside P3’s intervention influence engagement inside P3’s intervention, and subsequent PrEP adherence, 3) Determine how the P3 intervention condition attenuates the relationship between syndemic neighborhood and digital immersion factors’ impact on PrEP adherence. These aims will enrich our understanding of how digital and neighborhood factors impact PrEP adherence, a critical step in precision preventative health against HIV for YSGMSM.\n","date":1658188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658188800,"objectID":"bdfa26a6927262e65ac637c57002a596","permalink":"https://clashmt.github.io/project/f31/","publishdate":"2022-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/f31/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by NICHD, grant #1F31HD108046-01A1","tags":["Digital Interventions","Access"],"title":"Neighborhood and digital immersion effects on PrEP adherence in young sexual and gender minorities who have sex with men","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The crisis of deaths from opioid overdose persists in the United States and Impoverished individuals and those covered by Medicaid are disproportionately affected by the opioid crisis.Despite the availability of efficacious medications for treatment of opioid use disorder, treatment gaps exist.

This study compares cannabis retailer location information from online listings and government-maintained state registries overall, within states, and by legalization (medical or medical and recreational cannabis use).   Methods: We collected 7,832 cannabis retailer locations from five online listing sources (June 2019) and 7,733 cannabis retailer locations from government registries (May -- October 2019) across 26 states legalizing the sale of cannabis for medical or recreational use. We sequentially sampled 10% of retailers in each state for phone validation (n=826 online listings, conducted November 2019 – May 2020; n=856 government registries, conducted February – June 2020). Proportions of observations validated as operating cannabis retailers at listed locations by source were compared (overall, comparing states with both legalized medical and recreational cannabis use against states with medical only use, and by state) using chi-square tests.   Results: 74% (n=608) and 75% (n=639) of cannabis retailers were operating and located at listed locations for online listings and government-maintained registries, respectively(p=0.626).

In this study, we further investigate how older adults take the initiative role to support their health and well-being. To understand their active participation towards aging, we conducted an interview study with ten retirees who are \\\"aging in place\\\" (adults 65 and older who live independently). Our findings suggest that older adults are naturally developing a network of connections, which we refer to as their safety net. We have identified five social circles inside this safety net: predetermined, chosen, interest-based, location-based, and shared-identity circles. Each circle has a different impact on the support of older adults' health and well-being. Based on these findings, we suggest taking the safety net into consideration when designing technologies to promote and maintain healthy aging.","tags":["interviews","Older adults","active aging","safety net","well-being"],"title":"The Safety Net of Aging in Place: Understanding How Older Adults Construct, Develop, and Maintain Their Social Circles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiyang Wang","Tiffany Knearem","Fanlu Gui","Srishti Gupta","Haining Zhu","Michael Williams","J.

Such games may suffer from poor retention, potentially due to the constraints that using pre-existing problems place on game design. Previous work has proposed using player rating systems and matchmaking to balance the difficulty of human computation games, and explored the use of rating systems to predict the outcomes of player attempts at levels. However, these predictions were win/loss, which required setting a score threshold to determine if a player won or lost. This may be undesirable in human computation games, where what scores are possible may be unknown. In this work, we examined the use of rating systems for predicting scores, rather than win/loss, of player attempts at levels. We found that, except in cases with a narrow range of scores and little prior information on player performance, Glicko-2 performs favorably to alternative methods.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting Human Computation Game Scores with Player Rating Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anurag Sarkar","Michael Williams","Sebastian Deterding","Seth Cooper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658267175,"objectID":"fc112e26ae0a1763d41780acb1734d5c","permalink":"https://clashmt.github.io/publication/sarkar-engagement-2017/","publishdate":"2022-07-19T21:46:15.032084Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sarkar-engagement-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Human computation games lack established ways of balancing the difficulty of tasks or levels served to players, potentially contributing to their low engagement rates. Traditional player rating systems have been suggested as a potential solution: using them to rate both players and tasks could estimate player skill and task difficulty and fuel player-task matchmaking. However, neither the effect of difficulty balancing on engagement in human computation games nor the use of player rating systems for this purpose has been empirically tested. We therefore examined the engagement effects of using the Glicko-2 player rating system to order tasks in the human computation game Paradox. An online experiment (n=294) found that both matchmaking-based and pure difficulty-based ordering of tasks led to significantly more attempted and completed levels than random ordering. Additionally, both matchmaking and random ordering led to significantly more difficult tasks being completed than pure difficulty-based ordering. We conclude that poor balancing contributes to poor engagement in human computation games, and that player rating system-based difficulty rating may be a viable and efficient way of improving both.","tags":["matchmaking","difficulty balancing","Glicko-2","human computation games","level ordering","player rating systems"],"title":"Engagement Effects of Player Rating System-based Matchmaking for Level Ordering in Human Computation Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Williams","Hassen Gharbi","Aybike Ulusan","Ozlem Ergun","Zhu Xiaofeng","Shiyu Zhang","Casper Harteveld"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658267175,"objectID":"3bb3aba71930e2a54f69b6a03e801474","permalink":"https://clashmt.github.io/publication/williams-toward-2016/","publishdate":"2022-07-19T21:46:15.106694Z","relpermalink":"/publication/williams-toward-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Optimizing operations on critical infrastructure networks is key to reducing the impact of disruptive events. In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of having humans and algorithms work together to address this difficult task, which we refer to as human in the loop optimization. Additionally, we aim to use game-based experiments to build and assess this potential in the context of the debris collection problem. To start, we developed an Excel-based prototype which allow humans to propose their own solutions for simplified problem contexts. Through two within-subjects experimental studies we assessed how humans optimized under various circumstances with this prototype compared to the computer on its own. The results suggest that human input may indeed help in solving complex problems but that guidance is needed. Future work will focus on running additional game-based experiments.","tags":["critical infrastructure networks","game-based experiments","human in the loop optimization","resilience"],"title":"Toward Human in the Loop Optimization Through Game-Based Experiments","type":"publication"}]
